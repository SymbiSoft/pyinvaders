The goal of this project is to develop a simple and funny game where you must move your phone in the air to put the target on the spacecraft to fire.

The game is all developed in Python for S60 (PyS60).

The game doesn't use accelerometer, instead this game use the camera motion tracking to give the game a real cenario in the background.

This game should work in Symbian mobile phones Series 60 and screen resolution 240 x 320 pixels like N95, N73, etc.
